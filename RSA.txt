# Generating public/private rsa key pair.

# change directory to the .ssh folder
cd ~/.ssh

# Now generate ssh public/private key pair

ssh-keygen
OR
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# give file name to save the key(use full path if you are not in the .ssh directory)

id_rsa_bluehost
OR 
/root/.ssh/id_rsa_bluehost


# Then two files are created, private and public(.pub):
id_rsa_bluehost
id_rsa_bluehost.pub

# To see the content of the keys 
cat id_rsa_bluehost
cat id_rsa_bluehost.pub

# Copy the content of the public key and put it in your remote server
logi in to our host, eg. https://my.bluehost.com 
>> Advanced >> Security >> SSH Acess >> Manage SSH Keys 
>> Import Key >> Paste the public key and Import it >>  Manage >> authorize the Key

# Now Log in to the remote server with the server password:

ssh -p 2222 teraraor@50.87.249.41
OR
ssh -p 2222 teraraor@wubishet.com


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively you can generate public/private key pair from the host itself
logi in to our host, eg. https://my.bluehost.com 
>> Advanced >> Security >> SSH Acess >> Manage SSH Keys
>> Generate a new Key >> then download the private key to the local computer and put it in 
the .ssh directory and delete it from the host.
