# Copy Files to Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL with SSH

# Enable SSH in Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL
sudo apt remove openssh-server
sudo apt install openssh-server

# After reinstalling openssh-server, edit the sshd_config file to allow password authentication.
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin yes

# After editing your sshd_config file, restart your SSH service using the following command:
sudo service ssh restart

# Find the IP address for your WSL installation.
sudo apt install net-tools
ifconfig

# Now, we can use something like WinSCP to connect to the WSL installation.
After connecting, we see the filesystem and are now in a position to start copying files 
to Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL and back to the Windows host if needed. 
Also, you can edit files directly.
